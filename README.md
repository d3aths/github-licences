# Github Licences

This is an overview of the various copyright licences github offers as part of their repositories

## MIT Licence  
`mit`  
This is the most simple licence, and most common one that people use on Github for open source material. This allows anyone to use, modify, copy, publish, even sell the material without restriction, as long as the copyright notice is preserved - as in still included somewhere in the files.
